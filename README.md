# object-relational-covid19
This repository features an object-relational model (ORM) designed for managing and analyzing COVID-19 data. The project includes schema definitions and mappings to facilitate efficient data interaction and queries. It aims to support complex data relationships and enhance data-driven insights for pandemic analysis.

# Important Reports for Decision Making
1.	Report of average death rate per day of each state of every country at the end of the given time period
In this report the average percentage of death rate per day is calculated. That average of that death rate is taken under each state of every country.
Taking the average death rate helps the decision makers to predict the future death rates and take action to reduce it.
The average death rate of each country helps to makes decision makes to compare their countries with other countries and take actions. If a death rate of a country is the high, the countries can take proper actions to bring down the average death rate/percentage.

2.	Report of the total number of active patients in all the countries (in the world) on each day of the given time period
In this report the number of active patients (who are infected and currently receiving treatments) are calculated by number of confirmed cases â€“ (deaths + recoveries). Then the summation of the active patients on each day is taken.
This report helps the decision makers to get an overall idea about the situation in the world and to know how the number of active patients increase or decrease day by day.
This helps to plan and act to provide hospital and healthcare facilities they should provide and If their quarantine processes are showing successful results.

3.	Report of average recovery rate per day of each state of every country throughout the given time period 
In this report the average percentage of recovery rate per day is calculated. That average of the recovery rate is taken under each state of every country. This helps the decision makers to get and idea about if the actions they have taken to cure the infected people are working. If the recovery rate is getting higher it can be considered that the healthcare facilities are in a good, progressive state. If the average recovery rate is low more measures should be taken to treat the patients or improve the treatments.

4.	Report of countries that have an average of active patients per day equal or less than the average of active patients in China (origin country of the virus)
This helps the decision makers to get an idea about how much number of patients are in the hospitals at the time and how they should improve their health facilities. Also, by comparing their countries current patient average per day with China, the decision makers can get an idea and predict how the future pandemic situation will be their countries. They can take the actions China took to decrease the spreading of COVID 19.
 
5.	Report of active patient rate on each day in each country 
This report helps the decision makers to get an idea how the active patient date increased or decreased in each country day by day. This report acts as a feedback to the measures the countries has taken to prevent COVID 19.
Also, if they need, they can get the active patient rate on each day of a specific country by specifying the country in the where clause
